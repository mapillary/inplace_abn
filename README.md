# In-Place Activated BatchNorm

[**In-Place Activated BatchNorm for Memory-Optimized Training of DNNs**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02616)

In-Place Activated BatchNorm (InPlace-ABN) is a novel approach to reduce the memory required for training deep networks.
It allows for up to 50% memory savings in modern architectures such as ResNet, ResNeXt and Wider ResNet by redefining
BN + non linear activation as a single in-place operation, while smartly dropping or recomputing intermediate buffers as
needed.

This repository contains a [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of the InPlace-ABN layer, as well as some
training scripts to reproduce the ImageNet classification results reported in our paper.

## Overview

<p align="center"><img width="70%" src="inplace_abn.png" /></p>

When processing a BN-Activation-Convolution sequence in the forward pass, most deep learning frameworks need to store
two big buffers, _i.e._ the input `x` of BN and the input `z` of Conv.
This is necessary because the standard implementations of the backward passes of BN and Conv depend on their inputs to
calculate the gradients.
Using Inplace-ABN to replace the BN-Activation sequence, we can safely discard `x`, thus saving up to 50% GPU memory at
training time.
To achieve this, we rewrite the backward pass of BN in terms of its output `y`, which is in turn reconstructed from `z`
by inverting the activation function.

## Installation

Our code has only been tested under Linux with CUDA 8.0 / 9.0 and CUDNN 7.0.

### Requirements

To install PyTorch, please refer to https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#installation.

**NOTE: due to issues with PyTorch 0.3.0, our code _requires_ PyTorch v0.3.1 or newer, or PyTorch v0.2 (see https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/3883)**.

For all other dependencies, just run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Compiling

Some parts of InPlace-ABN have a native CUDA implementation, which must be compiled with the following commands:
```bash
cd modules
sh build.sh
python build.py
``` 
The `build.sh` script assumes that the `nvcc` compiler is available in the current system search path.
The CUDA kernels are compiled for `sm_50`, `sm_52` and `sm_61` by default.
To change this (_e.g._ if you are using a Kepler GPU), please edit the `CUDA_GENCODE` variable in `build.sh`.

### Data preparation

Our script uses [torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/datasets.html#torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder)
for loading ImageNet data, which expects folders organized as follows:
```
root/train/[class_id1]/xxx.{jpg,png,jpeg}
root/train/[class_id1]/xxy.{jpg,png,jpeg}
root/train/[class_id2]/xxz.{jpg,png,jpeg}
...

root/val/[class_id1]/asdas.{jpg,png,jpeg}
root/val/[class_id1]/123456.{jpg,png,jpeg}
root/val/[class_id2]/__32_.{jpg,png,jpeg}
...
```
Images can have any name, as long as the extension is that of a recognized image format.
Class ids are also free-form, but they are expected to match between train and validation data.
Note that the training data in the standard ImageNet distribution is already given in the required format, while
validation images need to be split into class sub-folders as described above.  

### Training

The main training script is `train_imagenet.py`: this supports training on ImageNet, or any other dataset formatted
as described above, while keeping a log of relevant metrics in Tensorboard format and periodically saving snapshots.
Most training parameters can be specified as a `json`-formatted configuration file (look [here](imagenet/config.py)
for a complete list of configurable parameters).
All parameters not explicitly specified in the configuration file are set to their defaults, also available in
[imagenet/config.py](imagenet/config.py).

Our arXiv results can be reproduced by running `train_imagenet.py` with the configuration files in `./experiments`.
As an example, the command to train `ResNeXt101` with InPlace-ABN, Leaky ReLU and `batch_size = 512` is:
```bash
python train_imagenet.py --log-dir /path/to/tensorboard/logs experiments/resnext101_ipabn_lr_512.json /path/to/imagenet/root
```

### Validation

Validation is run by `train_imagenet.py` at the end of every training epoch.
To validate a trained model, you can use the `test_imagenet.py` script, which allows for 10-crops validation and
transferring weights across compatible networks (_e.g._ from `ResNeXt101` with ReLU to `ResNeXt101` with Leaky
ReLU).
This script accepts the same configuration files as `train_imagenet.py`, but note that the `scale_val` and `crop_val`
parameters are ignored in favour of the `--scale` and `--crop` command-line arguments.

As an example, to validate the `ResNeXt101` trained above using 10-crops of size `224` from images scaled to `256`
pixels, you can run:
```bash
python test_imagenet.py --crop 224 --scale 256 --ten_crops experiments/resnext101_ipabn_lr_512.json /path/to/checkpoint /path/to/imagenet/root
```

### Usage for Semantic Segmentation on Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas

The currently released code can only deal with image classification tasks (like ImageNet), but we have successfully used InPlace-ABN with a DeepLab3 segmentation head that was trained on top of the WideResNet38 model above. Due to InPlace-ABN, we can significantly increase the amount of input data to this model, which eventually allowed us to obtain #1 positions on [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/benchmarks/#scene-labeling-task) and [Mapillary Vistas](https://eval-vistas.mapillary.com/featured-challenges/1/leaderboard/1) segmentation leaderboards. The training settings mostly follow the description in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02616) but we strive to release code later this year.
